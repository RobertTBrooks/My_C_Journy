/* * TITLE: Project 07 - Simple Word Counter
 * OBJECTIVE: Handle multi-word input and basic logic states.
 * * MAN PAGES TO READ:
 * 1. 'man 3 fgets' -> Unlike scanf, this captures spaces! Use 'stdin'.
 *
 * TO-DO HINTS:
 * 1. Use fgets(buffer, 100, stdin) to get a full sentence.
 * 2. A word starts when you find a character that isn't a space (' ').
 * 3. A simple way: count a word every time current char is NOT a space 
 * but the NEXT char IS a space or '\0'.
