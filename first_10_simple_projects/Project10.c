/* * TITLE: Project 10 - System Sleep Timer
 * OBJECTIVE: Interact with the OS clock to control program timing.
 * * MAN PAGES TO READ:
 * 1. 'man 3 sleep' -> Look at how it takes seconds as an argument.
 * 2. 'man 3 fflush' -> Useful if printf doesn't show up immediately.
 *
 * TO-DO HINTS:
 * 1. Ask user for a starting number.
 * 2. Use a 'for' loop counting down to 0.
 * 3. Inside: printf("%d\n", i); fflush(stdout); sleep(1);
 * 4. When the loop ends, print "BEEP BEEP!"
